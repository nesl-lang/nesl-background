method =- tools/call
myvar =- simple string
asdfes =- some other string it gets trimmed remember and has char limitations
full_l =::no space after the syntax cos this eats the whole line with no trimming
params = {
    name =::read_file â€” this whole line is the value for name incluidng {}[], etc 
    path =::/path/with spaces/and[brackets].txt
    asdf =::whole line gets read, no trimming. commas allowd
}

//no inline comments!  full line ocmments only
   // whitespace before comment is fine
ar = [
    ::el1
    ::el2
    - shouldthis be alowed
    - yes we should just mandate a space after the pipe cos it gets trimmed anyway
    ::is this too..., visually confusing tho?
    - i think it makes sense to mix pipes and double colon for formatting like unwrapping or compressing maybe
    (
        ::do we need 
        ::  double colon
        ::for each line like this
        - should this be allowed 
        - yes it just has to start with a space. i mean it doens't HAVE to.  but when beautified it will be added
    )
]


// note we sholdn't use spaces after - in inline arrays cos it woul dbe too cluttered.  
// i mean we never NEED space after the -, we just usually add for visual ease
