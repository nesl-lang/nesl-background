Great! Let's think through what we need to test thoroughly:

## Test Categories to Consider

### 1. **Basic Parsing**
- Simple key-value pairs
- Empty strings
- Strings with special characters
- Unicode in keys and values
- Whitespace preservation

### 2. **String Edge Cases**
- Strings containing the delimiter (e.g., `R"""pv(has )pv""" inside)pv"""`)
- Multiple delimiters on same line (should error)
- Empty strings vs whitespace strings
- Very long strings
- Strings with newlines (should error in single line context)

### 3. **Structure Tests**
- Nested objects (2, 3, 4+ levels deep)
- Nested arrays
- Mixed nesting (arrays in objects, objects in arrays)
- Empty structures (`{}`, `[]`, `()`)
- Single-item structures

### 4. **Multiline Strings**
- Basic multiline
- Empty lines in multiline
- Indentation preservation
- Empty multiline block

### 5. **Error Cases**
- Syntax errors (unterminated strings, bad markers)
- Structural errors (mismatched delimiters)
- Context errors (assignment in array, dash in object)
- Block structure errors (content after closing brace)
- Invalid keys (spaces, equals, empty)

### 6. **Block Wrapper Tests**
- Multiple blocks
- Blocks with text between them
- Invalid block structure
- Nested block markers (should they be treated as content?)

### 7. **Parser Behavior**
- Error recovery (continuing after bad line)
- Fatal vs recoverable errors
- Line ending normalization
- Whitespace line handling

### 8. **Custom Delimiter Tests**
- Basic parsing with custom delimiters
- Edge cases with custom delimiters
- Ensure defaults still work

## Questions to Resolve

1. **How granular should tests be?** One concept per file or group related tests?
2. **Error test format**: Should error tests specify exact error messages or just error codes?
3. **Should we test streaming/chunked input?** (Since it's line-oriented)
4. **Test file naming**: Descriptive (`nested_objects_with_arrays.nesl`) vs numbered (`001_nested.nesl`)?

## Test Structure Thoughts

Maybe organize by:
```
tests/cases/
  core/           # Basic functionality
  edge-cases/     # Tricky valid inputs  
  errors/         # Various error types
  blocks/         # Block wrapper specific
  custom-syntax/  # Custom delimiter tests
```

What aspects are most important to test first?

Yes, I feel good about it! It's comprehensive and covers all the important cases. 

My only thoughts:

1. **Priority order** - I'd start with:
   - Core functionality (basic strings, objects, arrays)
   - String edge cases (the delimiter-within-content cases)
   - Error cases (both fatal and recoverable)
   - Then the more exotic stuff

2. **Test organization** - I like the category-based folders over numbered files. Makes it easier to find/add tests.

3. **One thing to add** - Maybe a `regression/` folder for bugs we find later?

4. **For error tests** - I think error codes + message patterns would be good (not exact messages, which might change)

The test plan covers everything in the spec and then some. Ready to start implementing actual test files?


## Error Codes

Parser errors use descriptive string codes (e.g., `string_unterminated`, `delimiter_mismatch`) rather than numeric codes. This makes test files and error messages self-documenting without requiring lookups in separate documentation.

# tests example

```
tests/
  cases/
    valid/
      001_basic_string.nesl
      001_basic_string.json
      002_nested_objects.nesl
      002_nested_objects.json
    errors/
      001_unterminated_string.nesl
      001_unterminated_string.json
```

## Valid Tests

### `tests/cases/valid/001_basic_string.nesl`
```nesl
<<<<<<<<<nesl
{
  message = R"""pv(hello world)pv"""
  empty = R"""pv()pv"""
  spaces = R"""pv(  leading and trailing  )pv"""
}
=========nesl
```

### `tests/cases/valid/001_basic_string.json`
```json
[
  {
    "message": "hello world",
    "empty": "",
    "spaces": "  leading and trailing  "
  }
]
```

### `tests/cases/valid/002_nested_objects.nesl`
```nesl
<<<<<<<<<nesl
{
  user = {
    name = R"""pv(Alice)pv"""
    age = R"""pv(30)pv"""
    address = {
      street = R"""pv(123 Main St)pv"""
      city = R"""pv(Wonderland)pv"""
    }
  }
  tags = [
    - R"""pv(admin)pv"""
    - R"""pv(verified)pv"""
  ]
}
=========nesl
```

### `tests/cases/valid/002_nested_objects.json`
```json
[
  {
    "user": {
      "name": "Alice",
      "age": "30",
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Wonderland"
      }
    },
    "tags": ["admin", "verified"]
  }
]
```

## Error Tests

### `tests/cases/errors/001_unterminated_string.nesl`
```nesl
<<<<<<<<<nesl
{
  good = R"""pv(this is fine)pv"""
  bad = R"""pv(this string never ends
  another = R"""pv(unreachable)pv"""
}
=========nesl
```

### `tests/cases/errors/001_unterminated_string.json`
```json
{
  "errors": [
    {
      "line": 4,
      "code": "string_unterminated",
      "message": "String literal starting with R\"\"\"pv( was not closed with )pv\"\"\" on the same line",
      "content": "  bad = R\"\"\"pv(this string never ends",
      "context": "  good = R\"\"\"pv(this is fine)pv\"\"\"\n  bad = R\"\"\"pv(this string never ends\n  another = R\"\"\"pv(unreachable)pv\"\"\""
    }
  ]
}
```

Note: Line 4 assumes file-relative counting (not block-relative) for IDE compatibility.

> will it be hard to keep track of  line numbers if we're doing the 2 pass system of first extracting the blocks and then parsing the nesl?  how to approach that?  i mean knowing the line numbers.

## Line Number Tracking

Two-pass creates tracking complexity:

**Pass 1 (Block extraction):**
- Record: `blockStartLine` (absolute file position)
- Store with each extracted block

**Pass 2 (NESL parsing):**
- Parser works on isolated block string
- Reports block-relative line numbers
- Error reporter adds `blockStartLine - 1` to convert to file coordinates

**Implementation approach:**
```rust
struct Block {
    content: String,
    start_line: usize,  // File line where <<<<<<<<<nesl appears
}

struct Error {
    block_line: usize,  // From parser
    file_line: usize,   // Calculated: block.start_line + block_line
    // ...
}
```

Alternative: Single-pass parsing maintains file position naturally but violates separation of concerns.

## Column Numbers

**No, omit columns.**

Reasons:
1. **Line-oriented grammar** - Most errors identifiable by line alone
2. **LLM context** - With full line content, columns redundant for pattern matching
3. **Complexity cost** - Every parser rule must track/propagate column info
4. **Limited value** - Only helps with multiple errors per line (rare in practice)

Exception case: String delimiter errors (`R"""pv(` found but no `)pv"""`). But even here, the error message + line content sufficiently locates the issue.

The two-pass line tracking is solvable with bookkeeping. Column tracking isn't worth the implementation burden for a line-oriented language targeting LLM processing.

## Error Code Philosophy

Error codes represent **problem categories**, not specific instances. Each code maps to a class of errors that share the same root cause and fix strategy.

**Examples:**
- `delimiter_mismatch` - Any closing delimiter doesn't match opening (}, ], ))
- `string_unterminated` - Missing closing marker for any string literal
- `invalid_context` - Any syntax valid elsewhere but wrong in current state

**Rationale:**
1. **Maintainability** - ~15 codes vs ~50+ specific cases
2. **LLM-friendly** - Consistent codeâ†’category mapping aids pattern recognition
3. **Actionable grouping** - Errors with same fix strategy share codes
4. **Standard practice** - PostgreSQL, GCC, Rust all use category-based codes

**Message format:**
- Code identifies the problem class
- Message provides specific details ("Expected } but found ]")
- Context shows surrounding lines
- Together they enable precise error location and correction

So yes, delimiter_mismatch could cover:

"Expected } but found ]"
"Expected ] but found }"
"Expected ) but found }"
etc.

**Non-examples (too specific):**
- `expected_rbrace_found_rbracket`
- `string_missing_pv_marker`
- `assignment_in_array_context`

This approach balances precision with simplicity, providing enough information for both human and LLM debugging without code proliferation.
