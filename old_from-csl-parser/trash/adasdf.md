I'll convert that YAML to JSON for you. The main challenge here is preserving the multiline string with its specific formatting.

```json

      "nested_items": [
        {

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```




          This is a multiline string
             with inconsistent indentation
                and some lines have more spaces
           while others have fewer
                     like this one with many spaces
