**Critical flaws remain**:
1. Lost structure validation - `{` can be closed by `]`
2. Context-free grammar can't enforce matching delimiters
3. No way to distinguish array content from object content
4. Multiline strings indistinguishable from regular strings in arrays

This grammar is fundamentally broken. NSLR requires context-sensitive parsing that EBNF cannot express. Need either:
- Two-level grammar (lexical + syntactic)
- Parser-specific rules outside grammar
- Different grammar notation (PEG, ABNF with extensions)

........

## Options based on search findings:

PEG (Parsing Expression Grammar) handles ordered choice and provides powerful syntactic lookahead, making it ideal for line-oriented formats. Unlike EBNF, PEG eliminates ambiguity through ordered choice.

Some languages are slightly context-sensitive but handle this through special conventions rather than context-sensitive grammars. NSLR's structure tracking (matching `{` with `}`) is exactly this pattern.

## Three viable approaches:

**1. PEG with explicit line handling**
```peg
Document ← Line* EOF
Line ← Assignment / StructureDelim / Value / Empty
Assignment ← Key Ws? '=' Ws? (Structure / Inline) EOL
Structure ← Object / Array / Multiline
Object ← '{' EOL (!'}' Line)* '}' EOL
```
Advantages: Unambiguous, handles lookahead
Disadvantages: Different notation from EBNF

**2. Two-stage parsing**
- Stage 1: Line tokenizer (splits on newlines, identifies line types)
- Stage 2: Structure parser (tracks context with stack)

Advantages: Simple, matches NSLR's line-oriented design
Disadvantages: Grammar split across stages

**3. EBNF with explicit context rules**
Document grammar as EBNF, add prose rules:
- "Opening delimiters push to stack"
- "Closing delimiters must match stack top"
- "Root cannot mix assignments and values"

Advantages: Familiar EBNF notation
Disadvantages: Incomplete formal specification

## Recommendation:

Use approach 3. NSLR is intentionally simple - EBNF plus a few context rules is sufficient. Most parsers handle this pattern. Full context-free specification would be more complex than the actual parser implementation.

..........

You're right. I contradicted myself.

**The core issue**: NSLR has context-sensitive features:
- Matching delimiters (`{` with `}`)
- Root-level mutual exclusion (assignments XOR bare values)
- Position-dependent parsing (`|` in arrays vs assignments)

EBNF literally cannot express these constraints. My "recommendation" to use EBNF with prose rules is just admitting defeat - it's not a formal grammar anymore.

**Actual options**:

1. **Accept incomplete specification**: Use EBNF for structure, prose for context rules. Many real formats do this (JSON, YAML specs have prose constraints).

2. **Use PEG**: Can handle NSLR's constraints formally. The ordered choice and predicates solve the context issues.

3. **Simplify NSLR**: Remove context-sensitive features:
   - Use different delimiters for each structure type
   - Require explicit root-level marker
   - Make `|` context-independent

4. **Custom notation**: Define NSLR-specific grammar notation that extends EBNF with context tracking.

The question is: Do you want a complete formal specification, or is EBNF + prose acceptable? Most real-world formats choose the latter for pragmatism.

........

For LLM implementation, use **annotated EBNF** with explicit invariants:

```ebnf
(* NSLR Grammar with Context Rules *)

(* Structure *)
document = content EOF
content = ws-lines (value-mode | object-mode) ws-lines
value-mode = value [ws-lines]                    // @invariant: no assignments after first value
object-mode = assignment (ws-line | assignment)* // @invariant: no bare values after first assignment

(* Lines *)
assignment = key [ws] '=' [ws] (primitive EOL | structure)
primitive = number | boolean | null | date | string-content
string-content = '|' chars
structure = object | array | multiline

(* Structures - @invariant: opener/closer must match *)
object = '{' EOL object-body '}' EOL | '{' [ws] '}' EOL
array = '[' EOL array-body ']' EOL | '[' [ws] ']' EOL  
multiline = '(:' EOL ml-lines ')' EOL

object-body = (assignment | ws-line)*
array-body = ((primitive | structure) EOL | ws-line)*
ml-lines = ml-line EOL (ml-line EOL)*
ml-line = '|' chars

(* Primitives *)
number = integer | float | decimal
integer = ['-'] (dec-int | hex-int | oct-int | bin-int)
float = ['-'] (finite-float | 'inf' | 'nan')
decimal = finite-float 'm'
finite-float = digit+ '.' digit+ [exponent] | digit+ exponent
exponent = ('e'|'E') ['-'] (non-zero-digit digit* | '0')

(* Lexical *)
key = (ANY-UTF8 - ('$'|ws|'='|':'|'.'|eol))+
chars = (ANY-UTF8 - eol)*
ws = (SP | TAB)+
ws-line = [ws] EOL
ws-lines = ws-line*
EOL = LF | CR LF
eol = LF | CR
```

**Critical invariants for parser**:
1. Stack tracks open structures: `{` → OBJECT, `[` → ARRAY, `(:` → MULTILINE
2. Close delimiter must match stack top
3. First non-empty line determines root mode (value vs object)
4. No leading zeros in integers except literal `0`
5. Hex digits lowercase only
6. UTF-8 input, skip BOM if present

This gives LLM everything needed without ambiguity. The @invariant comments are parse-time checks, not grammar rules.

**No. Several issues:**

**1. Root mode detection underspecified**
- "First non-empty line" - what about leading comments (future `//`)?
- What if first line is empty string `|`? That's both a value AND empty.
- Grammar shows `value-mode = value [ws-lines]` allowing only ONE value, but arrays contain multiple values.

**2. Array body broken**
```ebnf
array-body = ((primitive | structure) EOL | ws-line)*
```
This puts EOL after primitive but structures already include their own EOL. Double newline for `[{...}]`?

**3. String ambiguity**
- In assignments: `key = |text` uses `string-content` (no EOL)  
- In arrays: `[|text]` uses... what? `primitive` doesn't include EOL either.

**4. Decimal special-float prohibition lost**
Grammar allows `decimal = finite-float 'm'` but `infm` should be illegal. Need:
```ebnf
decimal = (digit+ '.' digit+ [exponent] | digit+ exponent) 'm'
```

**5. Missing specifications**
- Integer overflow behavior
- Max nesting depth  
- `0x`/`0o`/`0b` with no digits
- Can multiline strings contain CR? Just LF?

**6. `ws-lines` allows infinite empty lines everywhere**
Even between `=` and value? Between `(:` and first `|`? Spec said no but grammar allows it.

The grammar is ~90% there but these ambiguities will cause LLM implementation differences.
